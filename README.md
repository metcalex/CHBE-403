This repo is a storage place for all the files needed to automate and run the HYSYS simulation. HYSYS files will be uploaded, as well as the matlab interfaces and the matlab code itself. Therefore, the complete code environment can be pulled down and used on any compatible computer. 

Additionally, Latex files will be added once work begins on the project.
